== Onboarding

Starting a new job can be exciting and a little scary. You meet a lot of
new people, have to work in a new environment, and is generally an
experience filled with unknowns. This is why Picnic has a clear
onboarding procedure, from the second you sign your contract, until the
end of your first month of work.

=== Moving to the Netherlands

Moving to a new country can always be a little daunting. Fortunately,
we're here to help! Have a look at the diagram below, which gives you an
overview of the different steps you, Picnic, and the Dutch government
will be involved in for your smooth transition:

=== Getting to know Picnic

So you're done moving (or were already here 😉), and you're ready for
your first day. Curious what to expect? Have a look:

* *Monday*: On day your first day, you'll receive a warm welcome, a
Picnic introduction, your gear and set-up the office systems. In the
afternoon, you'll spend 2-3 hours with the Customer Success team and
meet your buddy (see below).
* *Tuesday*: You'll have the chance to spend some time at the heart of
our supply chain. For half a day, you'll tag along a runner to see what the deliveries look like for Picnic and the customers.
* *Wednesday*: To continue the Picnic distribution experience, you'll spend one full day in one of our Fulfilment Centers to be a shopper. You'll get to see how every order is put together, from the moment it is delivered by our supplier, until it's dispatched to a hub.
* *Thursday*: First work-day! You'll be properly introduced to the team
and will be invited to the relevant Slack channels.
* *Within a couple of weeks, on a Friday*: _The Picnic Deep Dive,_ a
full immersion on all the Picnic teams to get to know their goals and
role better.

=== Your Buddy

Everyone who starts at Picnic is assigned a *buddy*, usually someone
with some experience in Picnic, with similar interests and personality.
If you'll work in the tech team, your buddy will also be from the tech
team, so he or she can help you set up your computer and development
environment. If you will work in any other team, your buddy will not be
from your team, to encourage intra company connectivity.

Here is what you can expect from your buddy:

* You'll share a coffee on your _first_ day.
* You'll check-in with one another _once_ per week.
* An approachable person who will enjoy answering any questions.
