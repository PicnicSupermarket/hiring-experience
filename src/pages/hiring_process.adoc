== Picnic's Hiring Experience

The Picnic Hiring Experience is designed to be efficient yet thorough,
so that everyone involved is 100% sure of the decisions they're taking.
For you, the candidate, this means an extensive look into how we work
and what we work with while remaining quick so that no one wastes any
time. For us, Picnic, it means an in-depth understanding of who you are,
and how you fit might into our team, so that once you're here, you'll be
at your happiest and most productive. If you're curious to know how we
make all this work, read on!

=== Application

* Duration: 1 to 2 days
* What is expected of you:
+
Send in your CV and cover letter (keep to the famous proverb: A cover
letter is always better). Don't hesitate to give us as much information
as you can (LinkedIn and GitHub profile, where you're from, where you
studied, etc.). This will help us make a more informed and faster
decision.
* What happens in the background:
+
Once you've clicked "Send", your application ends up in our Applicant
Tracking System (recruiters like to sound smart and usually call it an
ATS). We always aim to get back to you within 24 hours, but sometimes it
can take up to 48 hours until you hear back from us.

=== Phone call

* Duration: ~ 1 week (depending on your availability)
* What is expected of you:
** Phone call: You've passed the application stage and are now wondering what is going to happen. Well, here it is!
One of our Tech Recruiters will give you a call at a pre-determined
time, and during an informal and non-technical chat, will discuss the
following things with you:
*** Motivation: What is it about Picnic that attracts you so much? Is
there a specific reason you're leaving your current job? What does a
perfect job look like to you?
*** Experience: Where have you been and where do you want to go? What
is your favorite stack? What does your team look like?
*** Personality: What do you do besides work? What is your opinion on
code reviews? Would you be interested in joining a Picnic Club?
*** Practical stuff: What's your notice period? Are you moving to the
Netherlands (if applicable) on your own? Have you thought about your
salary expectations?
*** One word of notice: These are just examples, your interview might
be completely different, so make sure to prepare by doing some light
research and figuring out what you're looking for in your next
opportunity.
* What happens in the background:
** Phone call: Before any phone call, your Tech Recruiter will do a
quick check of your profile to note if there are any strange things that
they should mention (gaps in your timeline, short periods of work,
unfinished studies). If there is anything like that in your CV, make
sure you're able to give us a quick explanation.

=== Assignment & interview

* Duration: 1 to 2 weeks (dependent on speed)
* Assignment:
** What is expected of you:
You've had a good chat with your recruiter, and now it's time to get
down to business. Depending on the position you're applying for, the assignment will
have different goals and requirements, but they all share commonalities:
*** Quality of code: The main goal of the assignment is to assess your
technical abilities when you're performing at your best. Make sure to
give yourself the right environment to write the best code you can, and
don't hesitate to pull out all the stops to impress the tech team. But
remember, at Picnic, we like efficient answers, so avoid
over-engineering. ðŸ˜‰
*** Time limit: Officially, there is no deadline. Your time to submit
will *never* be taken into account, so if you think you're done but
could still use some time to polish a couple of things, do not hesitate to
take that time. However, after about a week without any contact, your
recruiter may come back to you to check-in and see if you need any help.
** What happens in the background:
Once you've submitted your assignment, two members of the tech team will
take a look independently, and then join and discuss. They will then
share their feedback with your recruiter, and together, they will decide
whether to invite you to the next stage: the technical interview.
* Interview
** What is expected of you:
Before the interview, we recommend you go over your work and prepare to answer any questions regarding your solution. The interview lasts roughly an hour and is divided into three main sections:
*** Introduction:
Your interviewers will introduce themselves and ask you to do the same.
*** Assignment:
This is the important part. The developers will focus on certain decisions you have made when working out your solution, so make sure you're able to communicate them clearly.
*** Questions:
If you have any questions (especially technical ones), now is the time to ask. ðŸ˜‰
** What happens in the background:
Once the interview is over, the developers will share their feedback with your recruiter, and together, they will decide whether to invite you to the last stage of the process: an on-site visit.

=== On-site visit

* Duration: 1 day
* What is expected of you:
+
During the visit, you will meet with a few different people, from
possible teammates, to our CTO. You will also have a white board session
or a pair programming session (some positions even have both included in
the visit), the only technical part of your visit. During this time, all
that we expect is that you be yourself. We understand that this can be a
stressful time for you, and we do everything we can to make as enjoyable
for you as possible, but being relaxed and trying to have fun is the
best way for us to see who you are.
* What happens in the background:
+
When you arrive at the office, your recruiter will be there to welcome
you. After a drink and a quick tour of the office, you'll be shown to
your first meeting. Halfway into the day, you'll share lunch with some
team members (on us ðŸ˜‰) and when everything is said and done, you'll sit
with your recruiter to share some feedback. During the day, your
recruiter will be meeting with the different people you met with to get
a sense of how the day is going, and before the final meeting with your
recruiter, everyone involved in your process will meet to discuss your
case and take a final decision.
