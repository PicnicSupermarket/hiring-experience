=== How long does the process take?

=== What about the moving costs?

When you move to Amsterdam to work at Picnic, we cover the costs of your flights (for you and your difrect family) and we put you up in one of the Picnic apartments (or hotel room should there be no apartment available) for one month, to give you time to find your own place while getting onboarded.
